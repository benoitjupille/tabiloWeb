Musical sequencer based on Web Audio API, jQuery, CSS and HTML.

How it works ?
=========

It's a musical sequencer. At the center, there is the "Master". Each other rounds are sound elements. Each element play on a definite time (1/4 or 2/4 etc...). The volume of an element is set by his distance between it and the "Master". When you click on an element, its parameters show / hide (attack, decay, release, delay time, cutoff...)

Road Map : 
=========

. Add a SQL Base which contains presets sequences.

. When you click on an element, the parameters show / hide. I should differentiate the click and drag actions.
